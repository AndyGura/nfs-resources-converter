| Offset | Name | Size (bytes) | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | **resource_id** | 4 | UTF-8 string. Always == "SHPI" | Resource ID |
| 4 | **length** | 4 | 4-bytes unsigned integer (little endian) | The length of this SHPI block in bytes |
| 8 | **num_items** | 4 | 4-bytes unsigned integer (little endian) | An amount of items |
| 12 | **shpi_dir** | 4 | UTF-8 string | One of: "LN32", "GIMX", "WRAP". The purpose is unknown |
| 16 | **items_descr** | num_items\*8 | Array of `num_items` items<br/>Item size: 8 bytes<br/>Item type: 8-bytes record, first 4 bytes is a UTF-8 string, last 4 bytes is an unsigned integer (little-endian) | An array of items, each of them represents name of SHPI item (image or palette) and offset to item data in file, relatively to SHPI block start (where resource id string is presented). Names are not always unique |

## **Bitmaps** ##
### **Bitmap8Bit** ###
#### **Size**: 16..? bytes ####
#### **Description**: 8bit bitmap can be serialized to image only with palette. Basically, for every pixel it uses 8-bit index of color in assigned palette. The tricky part is to determine how the game understands which palette to use. In most cases, if bitmap has embedded palette, it should be used, EXCEPT Autumn Valley fence texture: there embedded palette should be ignored. In all other cases it is tricky even more: it uses !pal or !PAL palette from own SHPI archive, if it is WWWW archive, palette can be in a different SHPI before this one. In CONTROL directory most of QFS files use !pal even from different QFS file! It is a mystery how to reliably pick palette ####
